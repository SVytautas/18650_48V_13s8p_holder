Round small thick circles is for disconnect balance wire. left just balance wires which requred up to 15 balance wire.
Cells pack is A B ir C 8p connected . A and B tie connected. conection and board symectrical then nest is fliped and co on up to 13 last is cuted in half.
Other side is starded fliped.

power plane is on top and botom depent what started it can be connected to minus or plus. can used to 4 lanes. 1 calculated should hold easy ~25A constant current. 4x 100A constant current.
